# try-bionode-esnext

My run through [try bionode](http://try.bionode.io) using ES6 and ES7 features,
notably, `async`/`await` from ES7 to avoid callbacks and write synchronous
looking asynchronous code. See `src/index.js`. You'll need

```bash
npm install -g babel-cli nodemon
```

and can start up the script with

```bash
npm run dev
```
